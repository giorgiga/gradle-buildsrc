# gradle-buildsrc

This is the `buildSrc/` I'm using on some projects of mine; it is not really intended to be usable by other people, but... feel free to do whatever you plase with it.

I might organise this stuff into a proper plugin some day, so let me know if you happen to be interested in helping with that.
